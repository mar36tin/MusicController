A fresh storm threatens to bring more misery to parts of the UK, including areas already hit by severe flooding.
Storm Frank is due to sweep in from Tuesday evening, with Cumbria and south and central Scotland at most risk.
There are four severe flood warnings - meaning "danger to life" - in force in England and Wales, along with 47 flood warnings requiring immediate action.
An old stone bridge in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, has collapsed, and as a result a nearby gas pipe has ruptured.
The area around the bridge, over the River Wharfe, has been cleared. Shops and businesses in the main street of the small market town have been badly affected by flooding since the weekend, and the bridge had been closed for the past two days.
Twelve people have been evacuated from their properties as a result of the gas leak.
